# BANG-The_Game
Making BANG the game in Java

Make sure when you push something to the master branch to tell everyone so we can quickly pull and update our code as well!

[Here](http://www.dvgiochi.net/bang_the_dice_game/BANG!_dice_game-rules.pdf) is a pdf of the rules online!



If you need help with how to use git and github here are some links on youtube on how to use it:
[The coding train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXT1ElMEkW8)
[Learncode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE&t=)

Both are really good at explaining what to do and how to do it!
